Files for 3D printing out the casing for the arm.

Includes:

* An STL & 3mf file (With each of the robot's parts)
* G-code files (for printing out each of the robot's parts on a Creality Ender 3 V-2 printer in two stages).
* An Apache License (for the SO-100 Model)

Print time ~2 days

The STL and 3mf are gotten from the SO-100 repository linked in the main README.
I generated the G-code files with Ultimaker Cura and split the STL with Mesh Tools (so the parts would fit on my build plate in two stages).
